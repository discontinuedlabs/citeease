## Installation

**Prerequisites**

-   **Operating Systems:** Windows, Linux, macOS
-   **Node.js and npm:** You'll need Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)

**Installation Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    Open your terminal and use the following command to clone the CiteEase repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/citeease.git
    ```

    Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd citeease
    ```

    Install all the project dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will download and install all the necessary libraries required to run the app.

**Starting the Development Server:**

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000/`.
