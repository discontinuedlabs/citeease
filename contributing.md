# Contributing

**Welcome Contributors!**

We appreciate your interest in contributing to CiteEase! This guide outlines the process for setting up your development environment, code style, contribution workflow, and testing practices.

**Setting Up Development Environment**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    Follow the steps mentioned in the installation guide to clone the CiteEase repository.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

**Coding Guidelines**

While there are no strict style guidelines, maintaining consistent and readable code is essential. We recommend using a code formatter like Prettier to ensure consistent formatting across the codebase.

**Contribution Workflow**

1. **Issues and Feature Requests:**

    If you encounter a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please create an issue on the project's GitHub repository. This helps us track and prioritize issues efficiently.

2. **Branching Strategy:**

    We encourage contributions through feature branches. Here's the recommended workflow:

    - **Fork the Repository:** Fork the CiteEase repository on GitHub.
    - **Create a Feature Branch:** Create a new branch for your specific contribution.
    - **Implement your Changes:** Make your changes within the feature branch.
    - **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages and push them to your forked repository.
    - **Create a Pull Request:** Open a pull request from your feature branch to the main branch of the upstream repository.

3. **Pull Requests:**

    Once you've pushed your feature branch, create a pull request on GitHub. This will allow maintainers to review your code and provide feedback before merging it into the main codebase.

**Testing**

While unit and integration tests are not currently implemented in CiteEase, we highly recommend adding them for future development. Here are some popular testing frameworks for React applications:

-   Jest: [https://jestjs.io/](https://jestjs.io/)
-   React Testing Library: [https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
